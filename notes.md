## give me liberty or give me death - pat henry

- no man thinks...and without reserve: ethos; show his credibility as someone who is not charged with anger and is speaking rationally
- this is no time...to this country: pathos; matter of slavery or freedom! scary!
- for my own part...earthly kings: logos; this is a complex issue; we must be free to debate. it is only logical that I give my opinion now; if I do not, then we will not arrive at the truth.

- mr. president...provide for it
    1. people are predisposed to stay passive (hope) rather than act, even when they are stuck in a bad situation
    2. wise men do not choose to stay passive at a time like this
    3. therefore, I do not want to stay passive; I want to give & know the whole truth

- I have but but one lamp...so long forging
    1. we have no way of judging the future but with past examples
    2. in the past 10 years, the british ministry has responded to our petition (for indep? peace?) with violence
    3. we have not done anything violent
    4. britain has no enemies in this bit of the world.
    5. there is no motivation for britain to install war implements in our waters other than to fight us

- and what have we to oppose...all that is left us!
    1. argument does not work, as seen over the past 10 years
    2. we do not have anything new to argue; argument will not work now.
    3. making requests humbly has not worked
    4. nothing we've tried before has worked; and we're humiliated.
    5. our peaceful requests have incited more violence from the british
    6. therefore, we must respond with violence if we mean to preserve our freedoms

- they tell us...
    1. we think we are not strong enough right now
    2. we will not get stronger through irresolution and inaction
    3. we have 3 million people
    4. we have god
    5. we cannot avoid battle now; it is either fight or die
    6. in reality, we are not weak, and we can fight.

- it is in vain, sir...
    1. the war has already started
    2. we should not stand idle
    3. a life of slavery is worse than dying for freedom
    4. we should fight rather than give up freedom

overall: we should fight for liberty immediately, because we have the means and have no choice other than to fight to preserve liberty.

uses logos the most; ethos and pathos also in 1st paragraph

## the crisis tom paine

this looks like pathos (religious appeals, anecdotes)

- these are the times...
    1. these are difficult times.
    2. tyranny is difficult to overthrow, but hard conflicts pay off
    3. we take freedom for granted
    4. britain has the power to enslave us and is using that power
    5. religious appeal: britain is taking powers that only god has

- i have as little superstition...
    1. god will not encourage war
    2. I don't believe that we have fallen to the devils and incited war
    3. therefore, the king of britain has little authority to be against us

- i once felt all that kind of anger... (anecdote with dad in tavern)
    1. some say to keep peace in the present
    2. it is unfatherly to say that; we should fight now so that our children won't have to
    3. we are separated from europe; we have nothing to do here other than trade
    4. therefore, america has the potential to be a peaceful place
    5. but war will always happen until foreign intervention is gone

- i turn with the warm ardor of... (define who he is friends with; I wanna be his friend!)
    1. friends with people who fight
    2. friends with the little who save the all
    3. friends with people continue despite adversity
    4. this war has a divine purpose; the darn brits are saying they're gonna bind us!
    5. call the king a brute

- there are cases which cannot be overdone by language...
    1. we cannot expect the enemy to be nice if they win
    2. mercy is a trick of war when conquest is happening
    3. we must stay vigilant so that we don't fall to this 

- mutual fear is the principal link...
    1. if the brits loved us, they'd try to get us to fear them?
    2. the brits are gonna destroy us

overall: argument against being a tory; again, we should fight immediately because it is for a good cause and because we cannot expect a good outcome if we do not fight.

uses pathos the most, logos at the end
